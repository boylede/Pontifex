	* container-based with `CARRY` support creeps
	* priority and distance-based target selection
	* link usage if present
* build & repair 
	* versatile creeps

* monitor creep levels and replace
* defense
	* tower-centric
	* targets healers first
	* defenders spawned manually

* new-fangled target assignment
	* task-based
	* capable of spawning new creeps if needed
	* can re-assign creeps
	* multi-room with independant rooms but can assign tasks across rooms
